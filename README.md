## Contributing

Your contributions are highly appreciated. Please [create a pull
request](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-libs/pulls) on GitHub. Bigger changes
need to be discussed with the development team via the [issues section at
github](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-libs/issues) first.

### Code style and formatting

Before creating a pull request, it is recommended to run the following command:

    make format

This reformats the new code to ensure that it follows the code style and
formatting guidelines.

### Static code analysis with the Clang Static Analyzer

If you want to use the Clang Static Analyzer (http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/)
to do a static code analysis, you can do so by prefixing the configuration and
build commands with `scan-build`:

    scan-build cmake ..
    scan-build make

The tool will provide a hint on how to launch a web browser with the results.

It is recommended to do this analysis in a separate, empty build directory and
to empty the build directory before `scan-build` call.
