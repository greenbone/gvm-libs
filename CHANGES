gvm-libs 1.0+beta1 (2018-04-17)

This is the first beta release of the gvm-libs module 1.0 for the Greenbone
Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework.

It derives from the former openvas-libraries module. Any elements of the
old module that were used by OpenVAS Scanner only, were moved into the
module openvas-scanner. Also the protocol OMP was renamed to GMP.

Apart from this, the module covers a number of significant advances
and clean-ups compared to the previous openvas-libraries module.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
Hani Benhabiles, Francesco Colista, Albrecht Dress, Christian Fischer, Matt
Mundell, Juan Jose Nicola, Timo Pollmeier, Bjoern Ricks, Jan-Oliver Wagner
and Michael Wiegand.

Main changes compared to openvas-libraries 9.0:
* Many files have been moved to this new module from openvas-libraries
  and other files have been renamed to match the new terminology (libgvm_*).
  Also the default installation paths switched from "openvas" to "gvm"
  and thus any include directive needs to be adapted in depdending source codes.
* Additionally OMP (OpenVAS Management Protocol) has been renamed to GMP
  (Greenbone Management Protocol), including library names, include files
  and data types.
* Function to handle IP connections has been removed since the scanner does
  only unix socket connections.
* Handling of vhosts and multiple domain names to one single IP have
  been added.
* Handling of hostnames that resolve to multiple IPs has been added.
* Handling of Unix and unknown socket types have been added to
  "sockaddr_as_str".
* Several function to handle the kb content have been added.
* A function to ping gvm has been added.
* New compress function with support for gzip header has been added.
* Access to XML entity properties has been improved.
* Host, IP address and port in gvm_server_open_verify are verified for sane
  values.
* Large file support when building with GPGME has been enabled.
* The symbol separator in a log message is now configurable.
* As all modules use the same log functions, legacy log functions have
  been removed.
* Old TODOs have been resolved.
* Documentation has been updated.
* Code readability has been improved by completing coverage of doc-strings.
* The CMake building process was improved.
* An issue template has been added.
* Several memory management issues have been addressed.
* Cmake macro file for code indentation has been removed.
* Minimum required version of glib/gio have been raised to 2.42.
* Minimum required version of zlib has been raised to 1.2.8.
* Minimum required version of cmake has been raised to 3.0.
* Minimum required version of libssh has been raised to 0.6.0.
