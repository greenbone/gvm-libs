gvm-libs 1.0+beta1 (2018-XX-XX)

This is the first beta release of the gvm-libs module 1.0 for the Greenbone
Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework.

It derives from the former openvas-libraries module. Any elements of the
old module that were used by OpenVAS Scanner only, were moved into the
module openvas-scanner.
 
Apart from this, the module covers a number of significant advances
and clean-ups compared to the previous openvas-libraries module.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
